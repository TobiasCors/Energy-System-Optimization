## Multi-Energy System Design Problem Overview

- **Objective**: Minimize total annual costs (investment + operational) while respecting budget constraints for multi-energy systems
- **Decision Variables**:

  - Investment variables (First Stage):
    - Storage energy capacity ($e^{nom}_s$) for both electricity and hydrogen storage
    - Storage charging power ($p^{ch,nom}_s$) for both energy carriers
    - Storage discharging power ($p^{dis,nom}_s$) for both energy carriers
    - Wind park capacity ($p^{nom}_w$)
    - PV park capacity ($p^{nom}_v$)
    - Electrolyzer capacity ($p^{nom}_x$)
  - Operational variables (Second Stage):
    - Wind power output ($p_{w,t,\omega}$)
    - PV power output ($p_{v,t,\omega}$)
    - Grid import/export ($p^{in}_{t,\omega}$, $p^{out}_{t,\omega}$)
    - Storage operation ($p^{ch}_{s,t,\omega}$, $p^{dis}_{s,t,\omega}$, $e_{s,t,\omega}$)
    - Electrolyzer operation ($p_{x,t,\omega}$, $h_{x,t,\omega}$)

- **Key Constraints**:

  - Investment budget limit
  - Electricity power balance
  - Hydrogen balance
  - Component capacity limits
  - Storage energy balance
  - Storage energy limits
  - Storage power limits
  - Electrolyzer conversion constraints

::: {.callout-note}
The Multi-Energy System Design problem extends the basic energy system design by incorporating multiple energy carriers (electricity and hydrogen) and energy conversion technologies (electrolyzers). The stochastic formulation considers multiple scenarios to account for uncertainty in renewable generation, demand patterns, and price variations across different energy carriers.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Objective Function

$\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} AC^{inv}_s + \sum_{w \in \mathcal{W}} AC^{inv}_w + \sum_{v \in \mathcal{V}} AC^{inv}_v + \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} AC^{inv}_x + \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} \pi_{\omega} (AC^{grid,imp}_{\omega} - AR^{grid,exp}_{\omega})$

### Key Constraints

1. **Investment Budget**:

$\sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} (C^{E}_s e^{nom}_s + C^{P,ch}_s p^{ch,nom}_s + C^{P,dis}_s p^{dis,nom}_s) + \sum_{w \in \mathcal{W}} C^{W}_w p^{nom}_w + \sum_{v \in \mathcal{V}} C^{PV}_v p^{nom}_v + \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} C^{X}_x p^{nom}_x \leq B^{max}$

2. **Electricity Power Balance**:

$\sum_{w \in \mathcal{W}} p_{w,t,\omega} + \sum_{v \in \mathcal{V}} p_{v,t,\omega} + (p^{in}_{t,\omega} - p^{out}_{t,\omega}) + \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}_{\text{El}}} (p^{dis}_{s,t,\omega} - p^{ch}_{s,t,\omega}) = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p_{x,t,\omega} \quad \forall t \in \mathcal{T}, \omega \in \Omega$

3. **Hydrogen Balance**:

$\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} h_{x,t,\omega} + \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}_{\text{H2}}} (p^{dis}_{s,t,\omega} - p^{ch}_{s,t,\omega}) = d_{t,\omega} \quad \forall t \in \mathcal{T}, \omega \in \Omega$

4. **Component Capacity Limits**:

$0 \leq p_{w,t,\omega} \leq f_{w,t,\omega} p^{nom}_w \quad \forall w \in \mathcal{W}, t \in \mathcal{T}, \omega \in \Omega$
$0 \leq p_{v,t,\omega} \leq f_{v,t,\omega} p^{nom}_v \quad \forall v \in \mathcal{V}, t \in \mathcal{T}, \omega \in \Omega$
$0 \leq p^{ch}_{s,t,\omega} \leq p^{ch,nom}_s \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}, t \in \mathcal{T}, \omega \in \Omega$
$0 \leq p^{dis}_{s,t,\omega} \leq p^{dis,nom}_s \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}, t \in \mathcal{T}, \omega \in \Omega$
$DoD_s e^{nom}_s \leq e_{s,t,\omega} \leq e^{nom}_s \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}, t \in \mathcal{T}, \omega \in \Omega$

5. **Storage Energy Balance**:

6. **Electrolyzer Constraints**:

$0 \leq p_{x,t,\omega} \leq p^{nom}_x \quad \forall x \in \mathcal{X}, t \in \mathcal{T}, \omega \in \Omega$
$h_{x,t,\omega} = \beta_x p_{x,t,\omega} \quad \forall x \in \mathcal{X}, t \in \mathcal{T}, \omega \in \Omega$

## Model Characteristics

- Two-stage stochastic Linear Programming (LP) problem for multi-energy systems
- Combines investment and operational decisions across multiple energy carriers
- Large-scale optimization problem with energy conversion technologies
- Requires efficient solution methods
- Considers multiple scenarios for robust decision-making
- Integrates electricity and hydrogen value chains

::: {.callout-tip}
The multi-energy system model can be adapted to specific use cases, i.e., if certain components already have fixed capacities, the corresponding variables can be converted to parameters. The stochastic formulation allows for more robust investment decisions by considering multiple scenarios across different energy carriers.
:::

## Key Extensions from Single-Energy Systems

### New Components
- **Electrolyzers**: Convert electricity to hydrogen with efficiency $\beta_x$
- **Hydrogen Storage**: Separate storage systems for hydrogen with different characteristics
- **Energy Conversion**: Explicit modeling of energy carrier conversion processes

### New Constraints
- **Hydrogen Balance**: Ensures hydrogen demand is met through production and storage
- **Electrolyzer Operation**: Links electricity consumption to hydrogen production
- **Multi-Carrier Storage**: Distinguishes between electricity ($\mathcal{S}_{\text{El}}$) and hydrogen ($\mathcal{S}_{\text{H2}}$) storage

### Modified Constraints
- **Electricity Balance**: Now includes electrolyzer consumption instead of direct demand
- **Investment Budget**: Includes electrolyzer investment costs
- **Objective Function**: Includes electrolyzer annualized investment costs

::: {.callout-note}
These extensions enable comprehensive optimization of energy value chains, allowing for optimal sizing and operation of systems that convert between the different energy carriers while considering uncertainty and operational constraints.

# [Excursion: Big M Constraints in Mixed-Integer Programming]{.flow} {.title}

## What are Big M Constraints?

Big M constraints are a fundamental modeling technique in Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) used to create conditional relationships between continuous and binary variables. The "M" represents a large constant that acts as an upper bound, allowing constraints to be "turned on" or "turned off" based on binary variable values.

::: {.callout-note}
Big M constraints enable the modeling of complex logical relationships and conditional constraints that would otherwise be difficult to express in linear programming formulations.
:::

## Basic Concept

The general form of a big M constraint is:

$f(x) \leq M (1 - y)$

where:

- $f(x)$ is a function of continuous variables
- $M$ is a large constant (the "big M")
- $y$ is a binary variable (0 or 1)

**Logic**: When $y = 1$, the constraint becomes $f(x) \leq 0$ (active). When $y = 0$, the constraint becomes $f(x) \leq M$ (inactive, since $M$ is large).

## Example from Unit Commitment: Startup Timing Constraints

Consider the constraint from the intermission lecture where generator 3 and generator 4 cannot start up within 3 time periods of each other:

$\sum_{\tau \in [t, \min(t+3,|\mathcal{T}|)]} v_{3,\tau} \leq (1 - v_{4,t}) M \quad \forall t \in \mathcal{T}$

$\sum_{\tau \in [t-1, \max(t-3,1)]} v_{3,\tau} \leq (1 - v_{4,t}) M \quad \forall t \in \mathcal{T}$

### How it Works:

1. **When $v_{4,t} = 1$** (generator 4 starts at time $t$):
   - The right-hand side becomes $(1-1) M = 0$
   - The constraint forces $\sum v_{3,\tau} \leq 0$
   - This means generator 3 cannot start in the specified time windows

2. **When $v_{4,t} = 0$** (generator 4 does not start at time $t$):
   - The right-hand side becomes $(1-0) M = M$
   - The constraint becomes $\sum v_{3,\tau} \leq M$
   - Since $M$ is large, this constraint is effectively not limiting the startup of generator 3 and hence not active

::: {.callout-tip}
The choice of $M$ is crucial: it must be large enough to make constraints inactive when needed, but not so large that it causes numerical issues in the solver.
:::

## Choosing the Right Big M Value

### Guidelines for Selecting M:

1. **Upper Bound**: $M$ should be an upper bound on the left-hand side expression
2. **Tightness**: Choose the smallest possible value that still works
3. **Numerical Stability**: Avoid extremely large values that can cause solver issues

### Example Calculation:
For the startup timing constraint, a good choice for $M$ would be:

- $M = |\mathcal{T}|$ (total number of time periods)
- This ensures that even if all startup variables were 1, the constraint would still be satisfied when inactive
- Considering that the fastest startup variable sequence is 1-0-1-0-..., M could be set to 2 here.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages:
- **Flexibility**: Enables modeling of complex logical relationships
- **Linear Formulation**: Maintains linearity of the optimization problem
- **Wide Applicability**: Can be used in many different contexts

### Disadvantages:
- **Numerical Issues**: Poor choice of $M$ can cause solver difficulties
- **Weak Relaxation**: Can lead to weak linear programming relaxations
- **Solution Quality**: May result in slower convergence

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. Indicator Constraints
Indicator constraints replace big M constraints with direct logical relationships. They are best suited for **simple binary conditions** where you have clear "if-then" relationships.

**Big M approach:**

$p_g \leq p_g^{max} u_g$

**Indicator constraint approach:**
```julia
@constraint(model, u_g => {p_g <= p_g_max})  # If generator is ON, then power ≤ max
@constraint(model, !u_g => {p_g == 0})       # If generator is OFF, then power = 0
```

**When to use**: Simple binary logic (on/off, yes/no, active/inactive)

**Key characteristic**: Direct logical statements without mutual exclusivity requirements

**Advantages:**

- No need to choose M values
- Often leads to tighter formulations
- More intuitive modeling
- Better numerical stability

**Disadvantages:**

- Not all solvers support indicator constraints
- May require specialized solvers

### 2. Disjunctive Programming
Disjunctive programming handles **complex multi-state conditions** where exactly one state must be active. It uses special ordered sets (SOS1) to enforce mutual exclusivity.

**Example**: A generator can operate in exactly one of three modes: off, minimum load, or full load.

**Big M approach:**

$p_g \leq (1 - u_g^{off}) + p_g^{min} u_g^{min} + p_g^{max} u_g^{max}$

$p_g \geq (1 - u_g^{off}) + p_g^{min} u_g^{min} + p_g^{max} u_g^{max}$

$u_g^{off} + u_g^{min} + u_g^{max} \leq 1$

**Disjunctive approach:**
```julia
# SOS1 ensures exactly one binary variable is 1, others are 0
@constraint(model, [u_g_off, u_g_min, u_g_max] in MOI.SOS1(3))
@constraint(model, u_g_off => {p_g == 0})                       # State 1: Off
@constraint(model, u_g_min => {p_g == p_g_min})                 # State 2: Minimum load
@constraint(model, u_g_max => {p_g == p_g_max})                 # State 3: Full load
```

**When to use**: Multiple mutually exclusive states or operational modes
**Key characteristic**: Enforces that exactly one state is active at a time

**Advantages:**

- More structured for complex logical relationships
- Can lead to better formulations
- Easier to understand complex constraints
- Enforces mutual exclusivity automatically

**Disadvantages:**

- More complex implementation
- May not be supported by all solvers

### Key Differences Between Approaches 1 and 2:

| Aspect | Indicator Constraints | Disjunctive Programming |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Complexity** | Simple binary logic | Multiple states |
| **Mutual Exclusivity** | Not enforced | Automatically enforced |
| **Use Case** | "If A, then B" | "Must be in exactly one of states A, B, C" |
| **Implementation** | Direct logical statements | SOS1 constraints |
| **Example** | Generator on/off | Generator off/min/max modes |

### 3. Reformulation
Sometimes big M constraints can be reformulated using additional variables or constraints that are more efficient or numerically stable.

**Example**: Instead of using big M for minimum up time constraints, use a different approach.

**Big M approach:**

$\sum_{t'=t}^{t+T^{min}-1} u_{g,t'} \geq T^{min} v_{g,t}$

**Reformulation approach:**
```julia
# Use a continuous variable to track remaining minimum up time
@variable(model, 0 <= remaining_up_time[g, t] <= T_min)
@constraint(model, remaining_up_time[g, t] <= T_min * u_g[t])
@constraint(model, remaining_up_time[g, t] <= remaining_up_time[g, t-1] - 1 + T_min * v_g[t])
@constraint(model, remaining_up_time[g, t] >= 0)
```

**Advantages:**

- Often more numerically stable
- Can provide tighter formulations
- May lead to faster solution times

**Disadvantages:**

- More complex to implement
- Requires more variables and constraints
- May not always be possible

::: {.callout-note}
Big M constraints are a powerful tool in MILP modeling, but they should be used carefully with appropriate values for $M$ to ensure both correctness and computational efficiency.
:::

## Practical Tips

1. **Document your choice of M**: Always explain why you chose a particular value
2. **Test with small instances**: Verify that your constraints work as expected
3. **Consider solver-specific features**: Some solvers have built-in support for certain constraint types
4. **Monitor solution times**: If the problem is slow to solve, consider if big M constraints are the bottleneck

## Framework for Multi-Energy System Design Problem

In this lecture, we reformulate the Stochastic Multi-Energy System Design problem to be applicable to a wide range of energy system applications *only by changing the sets and parameters*. This allows us to:

1. Adapt the model to the specific energy system application by changing the sets and parameters
2. Optimize technology selection over the entire energy value chain
3. Determine optimal component sizes
4. Balance investment and operational costs
5. Plan local multi-energy systems holistically (e.g. electricity, hydrogen, heat, etc.)

::: {.callout-note}
Remember: The design problem combines investment planning (sizing) with operational optimization, enabling comprehensive (multi-)energy system design.

2. Specifying technology types in $\mathcal{G}$
3. Setting conversion parameters $\sigma_{g,e}^{in}$, $\sigma_{g,e}^{out}$, and $\Theta_g$
4. Adding application-specific constraints as needed
