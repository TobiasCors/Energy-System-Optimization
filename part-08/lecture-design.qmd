## Mathematical Formulation

### Objective Function

$\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \left( \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} (c^{var}_g p_{g,t} + c^{fix}_g u_{g,t} + c^{start}_g v_{g,t}) + \sum_{w \in \mathcal{W}} c^{var}_w p_{w,t} \right)$

### Key Constraints

1. **Power Balance**:

$\sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{g,t} + \sum_{w \in \mathcal{W}} p_{w,t} + \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} (p^{dis}_{s,t} - p^{ch}_{s,t}) = d^f_t \quad \forall t \in \mathcal{T}$

2. **Generator Limits**:

$p^{\min}_g u_{g,t} \leq p_{g,t} \leq p^{\max}_g u_{g,t} \quad \forall g \in \mathcal{G}, t \in \mathcal{T}$

3. **Wind Power**:

$0 \leq p_{w,t} \leq p^f_{w,t} \quad \forall w \in \mathcal{W}, t \in \mathcal{T}$

4. **Storage Energy Balance**:

$e_{s,t} = (1-sdr_s)e_{s,t-1} + \eta^{ch}_s p^{ch}_{s,t} - \frac{p^{dis}_{s,t}}{\eta^{dis}_s} \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}, t \in \mathcal{T}$

5. **Storage Energy Limits**:

6. **Storage Power Limits and Mutual Exclusion**:

$0 \leq p^{ch}_{s,t} \leq P^{ch,max}_s u^{ch}_{s,t} \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}, t \in \mathcal{T}$
$0 \leq p^{dis}_{s,t} \leq P^{dis,max}_s u^{dis}_{s,t} \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}, t \in \mathcal{T}$
$u^{ch}_{s,t} + u^{dis}_{s,t} \leq 1 \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}, t \in \mathcal{T}$

7. **Storage Ramp Rate Limits**:

$p^{ch}_{s,t} - p^{ch}_{s,t-1} \leq R^{ch}_s \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}, t \in \mathcal{T}$
$p^{dis}_{s,t} - p^{dis}_{s,t-1} \leq R^{dis}_s \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}, t \in \mathcal{T}$

# [Excursion: Tight and Compact Formulations]{.flow} {.title}

## What are Tight and Compact Formulations?

In mathematical optimization, particularly for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems like the Unit Commitment problem, the concepts of "tight" and "compact" formulations are crucial for efficient problem solving.

### Tight Formulations

A formulation is considered "tight" when there is a small gap between the optimal solution of the linear programming (LP) relaxation and the integer solution. This is important because:

- It helps solvers find optimal solutions faster
- It provides better lower bounds for branch-and-bound algorithms
- It reduces the search space for integer solutions

### Compact Formulations

A formulation is considered "compact" when it uses fewer variables and constraints while maintaining accuracy. This is important because:

- It reduces computational complexity
- It decreases memory requirements
- It can speed up solution times
- It makes the model easier to understand and maintain

## Examples in UC with Storage

### 1. Tight Formulations

#### Example 1 - Generator Commitment:
```math
# Less tight formulation
p_{g,t} ≤ P^{max}_g u_{g,t}  # Only upper bound

# Tighter formulation
P^{min}_g u_{g,t} ≤ p_{g,t} ≤ P^{max}_g u_{g,t}  # Both bounds
```
- The second formulation is tighter because it includes both minimum and maximum power constraints
- This reduces the feasible region of the LP relaxation
- Makes it easier for the solver to find integer solutions

#### Example 2 - Storage Operation:
```math
# Less tight formulation
e_{s,t} = e_{s,t-1} + p^{ch}_{s,t} - p^{dis}_{s,t}  # Without efficiency

# Tighter formulation
e_{s,t} = (1-sdr_s)e_{s,t-1} + η^{ch}_s p^{ch}_{s,t} - p^{dis}_{s,t}/η^{dis}_s  # With efficiency
```
- The second formulation is tighter because it accounts for efficiency losses
- This better represents the physical reality of storage operation
- Helps the solver find more realistic solutions

### 2. Compact Formulations

#### Example 1 - Minimum Up/Down Times:
```math
# Less compact formulation
u_{g,t} - u_{g,t-1} ≤ u_{g,τ}  ∀τ ∈ [t+1, t+T^{up}_g-1]
u_{g,t-1} - u_{g,t} ≤ 1 - u_{g,τ}  ∀τ ∈ [t+1, t+T^{down}_g-1]

# More compact formulation
∑_{τ=t}^{t+T^{up}_g-1} u_{g,τ} ≥ T^{up}_g (u_{g,t} - u_{g,t-1})
∑_{τ=t}^{t+T^{down}_g-1} (1-u_{g,τ}) ≥ T^{down}_g (u_{g,t-1} - u_{g,t})
```
- The second formulation uses fewer constraints
- Achieves the same result with less computational overhead
- Makes the model more efficient to solve

#### Example 2 - Storage Mutual Exclusion:
```math
# Less compact formulation
p^{ch}_{s,t} ≤ P^{ch,max}_s u^{ch}_{s,t}
p^{dis}_{s,t} ≤ P^{dis,max}_s u^{dis}_{s,t}
u^{ch}_{s,t} + u^{dis}_{s,t} ≤ 1

# More compact formulation
p^{ch}_{s,t}/P^{ch,max}_s + p^{dis}_{s,t}/P^{dis,max}_s ≤ 1
```
- The second formulation combines three constraints into one
- Reduces the number of binary variables needed
- Simplifies the model while maintaining accuracy

## Why These Concepts Matter

### Computational Efficiency
- Tighter formulations reduce the search space
- Compact formulations reduce the problem size
- Both lead to faster solution times

### Solution Quality
- Tighter formulations provide better bounds
- Help find optimal solutions more reliably
- Reduce the gap between LP relaxation and integer solution

### Practical Implementation
- More efficient use of computational resources
- Better handling of large-scale problems
- More reliable results for real-world applications

## Trade-offs to Consider

### Tightness vs. Compactness
- Sometimes making a formulation tighter makes it less compact
- Need to balance between tightness and problem size
- Choose based on specific problem characteristics

### Model Complexity
- More complex formulations might be tighter but harder to understand
- Simpler formulations might be more compact but less accurate
- Need to find the right balance for your specific use case

::: {.callout-note}
These concepts are particularly important in the Unit Commitment problem with storage and approximations of part-load efficiencies because:

1. The problem is already complex with many variables and constraints
2. Storage adds additional complexity with its operational constraints
3. Real-world applications need efficient solutions
4. The problem size can grow quickly with more time periods or storage units

# [Introduction]{.flow} {.title}

## Energy System Design Problem

## Present Value Annuity Factor (PVAF)

The Present Value Annuity Factor (PVAF) is used to convert investment costs into equivalent annual costs. It is calculated as:

$F^{PVAF} = \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r(1 + r)^n}$

where:
- $r$ is the discount rate (e.g., 0.05 for 5%)
- $n$ is the component lifetime in years (we assume the same lifetime for all components in the following)

This factor allows us to:

1. Convert one-time investment costs into equivalent annual costs
2. Account for the time value of money
3. Compare investments with different lifetimes
4. Make investment decisions based on annual costs

## Objective Function

$\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} AC^{inv}_s + \sum_{w \in \mathcal{W}} AC^{inv}_w + \sum_{v \in \mathcal{V}} AC^{inv}_v + AC^{grid,imp} - AR^{grid,exp}$

::: {.callout-note}
The objective function minimizes the total annual costs of the energy system:

1. Investment costs for all components:

   - Storage systems (energy and power capacity)
   - Wind parks
   - PV parks

2. Grid electricity costs/revenues:

   - Import costs (market price + taxes/levies including Netzentgelt)
   - Export revenue (market price only)
:::

## Annual Cost Constraints

### Investment Costs
$AC^{inv}_s = \frac{C^{E}_s}{F^{PVAF}} e^{nom}_s + \frac{C^{P,ch}_s}{F^{PVAF}} p^{ch,nom}_s + \frac{C^{P,dis}_s}{F^{PVAF}} p^{dis,nom}_s \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}$
$AC^{inv}_w = \frac{C^{W}_w}{F^{PVAF}} p^{nom}_w \quad \forall w \in \mathcal{W}$
$AC^{inv}_v = \frac{C^{PV}_v}{F^{PVAF}} p^{nom}_v \quad \forall v \in \mathcal{V}$

1. Storage investment includes:

   - Energy capacity costs
   - Charging power capacity costs
   - Discharging power capacity costs

2. Wind and PV investment include:

   - Power capacity costs only
:::

### Investment Budget

The investment budget constraint ensures that:

1. Total investment costs do not exceed the maximum budget

2. Includes all component investments:

   - Storage systems (energy and power capacity)
   - Wind parks
   - PV parks
:::

### Grid Electricity Costs

$AR^{grid,exp} = \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} c^{MP}_t p^{out}_t$

::: {.callout-note}
The grid electricity costs and revenues are calculated as:

1. Import costs include:

   - Time-dependent market price
   - Fixed taxes and levies (including Netzentgelt)

2. Export revenue includes:

   - Time-dependent market price only
:::

## Constraints

### Power Balance
$\sum_{w \in \mathcal{W}} p_{w,t} + \sum_{v \in \mathcal{V}} p_{v,t} + (p^{in}_t - p^{out}_t) + \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} (p^{dis}_{s,t} - p^{ch}_{s,t}) = d_t \quad \forall t \in \mathcal{T}$
