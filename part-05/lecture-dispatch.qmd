# [Quick Recap from last Week]{.flow} {.title}

## JuMP

- JuMP is a package for modeling optimization problems in Julia
- It allows you to describe optimization problems in a way that is easy to understand and solve
- It is a powerful tool for modeling and solving optimization problems

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
Use meaningful variable names and comments to make your model easier to understand.
:::

## Bounds

- Variables in optimization models often need upper and lower bounds
- Bounds can be set when declaring variables or added later as constraints
- Common bounds include non-negativity ($\leq 0$) and capacity limits

## Constraints

- Constraints define the feasible region of the optimization problem
- Can be equality ($=$) or inequality ($\geq, \leq$) constraints
- Multiple constraints can be added using loops or array comprehensions

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
Conditional constraints allow flexible and dynamic model formulations reflecting conditions and dependencies in the constraint application.
:::

## Solver

- JuMP supports many different solvers like HiGHS, GLPK, Gurobi
- Solvers are specialized for different problem types (LP, MIP, NLP)
- Can set solver parameters to control solution process

## Model Setup

- Start by creating a model with `Model()`
- Add variables, objective function, and constraints
- Call `optimize!()` to solve the model
- Access results through solution queries

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
Always check the solution status before using the results to ensure the model solved successfully.
:::

## Solutions from last Week

- The tutorials from last week will again be [available on Friday]{.highlight}
- You can access them in the project folder on Github
- Click on the little cat icon on the bottom right

**Power system system with generators and an aggregated demand**

- Generators have to be dispatched to meet the demand at an infinitesimal moment
- Generators have different costs and operational constraints
:::
:::

## Economic Dispatch Problem

- **Objective**: Minimize the cost of producing electricity
- **Constraints** in the simplest case: 
    - Demand must be met
    - Generators have limits on their power output
    - Renewable power injection
- **Decision variables**: 
    - Power output of thermal generators
    - Power output of renewables, e.g. wind

:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}

. . .

[And that's basically it!]{.highlight}

## Economic Dispatch: Objective Function

$\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{g=1}^{\mathcal{G}} (c^{var}_g p_g) + \sum_{w=1}^{\mathcal{W}} (c^{var}_w p_w)$

:::

## Economic Dispatch: Constraints

$p^{\min}_g \leq p_g \leq p^{\max}_g \quad \forall g\in\mathcal{G}$$

$0 \leq p_w \leq p^f_w \quad \forall w\in\mathcal{W}$$

$\sum_{g=1}^{\mathcal{G}} p_g + \sum_{w=1}^{\mathcal{W}} p_w = d^f$$

::: {.callout-important}
## Our constraints ensure:

Generator limits are respected, wind power is bounded by forecast, and power balance is maintained.

:::

## Economic Dispatch: Variable Domains

$p_g \geq 0 \quad \forall g\in\mathcal{G}$

$p_w \geq 0 \quad \forall w\in\mathcal{W}$

::: {.callout-important}
## The variable domains make sure that:

All power outputs are non-negative.

:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Are these necessary?**

## Economic Dispatch: Complete Model

$\text{Minimize} \quad \sum_{g=1}^{\mathcal{G}} (c^{var}_g p_g) + \sum_{w=1}^{\mathcal{W}} (c^{var}_w p_w)$

subject to

$\sum_{g=1}^{\mathcal{G}} p_g + \sum_{w=1}^{\mathcal{W}} p_w = d^f$

$p^{\min}_g \leq p_g \leq p^{\max}_g \quad \forall g\in\mathcal{G}$

$0 \leq p_w \leq p^f_w \quad \forall w\in\mathcal{W}$

## What are further considerations to make?

- on/off status of system components 
-> unit commitment (UC) problem
- efficiency losses
- ramp rates
- minimum up- and downtimes
- storages
-> multiple timesteps
- uncertainty in forecasts

## {.loud-slide}
::: {.r-fit-text}
Any idea how to 

adapt the ED to UC?

## Power System Basic Models: Unit Commitment

- considers binary decisions if a unit, e.g., thermal generator, in the power system is switched on or off
- decision are made over a time horizon, which means that variables are also indexed by timesteps.

We will cover the unit commitment problem in the next lecture.

. . .


::: {.callout-note}
## And that's it for todays lecture!

We now have covered the basics of the ED and are ready to start solving some tasks in the upcoming tutorial.
