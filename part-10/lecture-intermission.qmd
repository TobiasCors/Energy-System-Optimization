## Energy System Modeling

## 1.a (8 Points) {.scrollable}

A power system operator needs to optimize the economic dispatch of thermal generators to meet electricity demand. The system consists of:

- Multiple thermal generators with different variable costs
- Wind turbines with forecasted power output
- A single aggregated demand that must be met

Each generator has minimum and maximum power output limits. The wind turbines have zero variable cost but their output is limited by the forecast.

Define all sets, parameters, and variables required to model this Economic Dispatch problem. Use clear notation and explicitly state which elements are sets, parameters, and variables.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}

**Solution**

**Sets:**
- $g \in \mathcal{G}$ : Set of thermal generators
- $w \in \mathcal{W}$ : Set of wind turbines

**Parameters:**
- $c^{var}_g$ : Variable cost of generator $g$ [€/MWh]
- $p^{\min}_g$ : Minimum power output of generator $g$ [MW]
- $p^{\max}_g$ : Maximum power output of generator $g$ [MW]
- $p^f_w$ : Forecasted power output of wind turbine $w$ [MW]
- $d^f$ : Forecasted demand [MW]

**Variables:**
- $p_g$ : Power output of thermal generator $g$ [MW]
- $p_w$ : Power output of wind turbine $w$ [MW]

## 1.b (4 Points) {.scrollable}

Based on your notation from 1.a, write the objective function for the Economic Dispatch problem.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}

**Solution**

$$
\text{min} \quad \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} c^{var}_g p_g
$$

Note: Wind turbines have zero variable cost, so they don't appear in the objective function.

**Solution**

**Power Balance:**
$$
\sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} p_g + \sum_{w \in \mathcal{W}} p_w = d^f
$$

**Generator Limits:**
$$
p^{\min}_g \leq p_g \leq p^{\max}_g \quad \forall g \in \mathcal{G}

Now extend the Economic Dispatch model to include Unit Commitment decisions. The generators can be turned on/off and have additional start-up costs.

Define the additional sets, parameters, and variables needed for the Unit Commitment problem.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}

**Solution**

**Additional Sets:**
- $t \in \mathcal{T}$ : Set of time periods

**Additional Parameters:**
- $c^{start}_g$ : Start-up cost of generator $g$ [€]

**Additional Variables:**

## 1.e (6 Points) {.scrollable}

Write the (a) objective function and (b) start-up variable definition for the Unit Commitment problem using your notation from 1.d. In addition, consider that (c) generator 1 and 2 use the same grid connection which is currently limited so that they cannot be on at the same time. An additional constraint is that (d) due to personnel reasons the startup of generator 3 has to be at least 3 timesteps away from startup of generator 4.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}

**Solution**

**(a) Objective Function:**
$$
\text{min} \quad \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \left( \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} (c^{var}_g p_{g,t} + c^{start}_g v_{g,t}) \right)
$$

**(b) Start-up Variable Definition:**
$$
v_{g,t} \geq u_{g,t} - u_{g,t-1} \quad \forall g \in \mathcal{G}, t \in \mathcal{T}
$$

**(c) Grid Connection Limits:**
$$
u_{1,t} + u_{2,t} \leq 1 \quad \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
$$

**(d) Startup of Generator 3 has to be at least 3 timesteps away from startup of generator 4:**
$$
\sum_{\tau \in [t, \min(t+3,|\mathcal{T}|)]} v_{3,\tau} \leq (1 -v_{4,t}) M \quad \forall t \in \mathcal{T} \quad \text{with} \quad M = |\mathcal{T}|

\sum_{\tau \in [t-1, \max(t-3,1)]} v_{3,\tau} \leq (1 -v_{4,t}) M \quad \forall t \in \mathcal{T} \quad \text{with} \quad M = |\mathcal{T}|

## Theory and Concepts

## 2.a (3 Points) {.scrollable}

What is the main difference between Economic Dispatch and Unit Commitment problems? Explain in 2-3 sentences.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}

**Solution**

Economic Dispatch optimizes power generation for a single time step assuming all generators are already committed to operation, focusing only on power output levels. Unit Commitment extends this by adding binary decisions for generator on/off status, considering multiple time periods, and including operational constraints such as start-up costs, minimum up/down times, and ramp rate limits. This makes Unit Commitment more realistic but computationally more complex.

## 2.b (3 Points) {.scrollable}

Explain what a "tight formulation" means in the context of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems like Unit Commitment.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}

**Solution**

A tight formulation in MILP has a small gap between the optimal solution of the linear programming (LP) relaxation and the integer solution. This is important because it helps solvers find optimal solutions faster, provides better lower bounds for branch-and-bound algorithms, and reduces the search space for integer solutions. For example, including both minimum and maximum power constraints for generators creates a tighter formulation than only including maximum constraints.

## 2.c (3 Points) {.scrollable}

What is the purpose of storage systems in energy system optimization? Name three key constraints that are typically included in storage modeling.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}

**Solution**

Storage systems in energy system optimization serve to balance supply and demand over time, store excess renewable energy, and provide flexibility to the power system. Three key constraints typically included in storage modeling are:

1. **Energy balance constraint**: Links energy levels between consecutive time periods considering charging/discharging efficiency and self-discharge
2. **Energy capacity limits**: Ensures storage energy level stays within minimum and maximum bounds
3. **Power limits and mutual exclusion**: Prevents simultaneous charging and discharging while respecting maximum charging/discharging power rates

## 2.d (3 Points) {.scrollable}

Explain the concept of "two-stage stochastic programming" in the context of energy system design problems.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}

**Solution**

Two-stage stochastic programming in energy system design separates decisions into two stages: first-stage (here-and-now) decisions made before uncertainty is revealed (e.g., investment in generation capacity, storage size), and second-stage (wait-and-see) decisions made after uncertainty is revealed (e.g., operational decisions like power dispatch, storage operation). This approach allows for robust investment decisions by considering multiple scenarios of renewable generation, demand patterns, and price variations, leading to more resilient energy system designs.

## 2.e (3 Points) {.scrollable}

What are the main advantages of using Julia and JuMP for energy system optimization compared to other programming languages and modeling frameworks?

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}

**Solution**

Julia and JuMP offer several advantages for energy system optimization: high performance comparable to compiled languages while maintaining ease of use, seamless integration with multiple solvers (HiGHS, Gurobi, etc.), excellent support for mathematical notation that closely resembles mathematical formulations, efficient handling of large-scale optimization problems, and strong ecosystem for data analysis and visualization. Additionally, JuMP's syntax is intuitive for expressing mathematical models, making it easier to translate theoretical formulations into working code.

## 3.a (8 Points) {.scrollable}

The following Julia code contains four errors related to implementing an Economic Dispatch model. Identify and briefly describe each error.

```julia
# Load the necessary packages
using JuMP
using HiGHS

# Define the size of the problem instance
nrGenerators = length(generatorCosts)
nrWindTurbines = length(windForecast)

# Create model instance
dispatch = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)

# Define variables
@variable(dispatch_model, p_g[g = 1:nrGenerators] >= 0)
@variable(dispatch_model, p_w[w = 1:nrWindTurbines] >= 0)

# Define objective
@objective(dispatch_model, Max, 
    sum(generatorCosts[g] * p_g[g] for g in 1:nrGenerators)
    )

# Define the constraints
@constraint(dispatch_model, 
    power_balance, 
    sum(p_g[g] for g in 1:nrGenerators) + sum(p_w[w] for w in 1:nrWindTurbines) === demand
    )

@constraint(dispatch_model,
    generator_limits[g=1:nrGenerators], 
    p_g[g] <= maxPower[g]
    )

@constraint(dispatch_model,
    wind_limits[w=1:nrWindTurbines], 
    p_w[w] <= windForecast[w]
    )

# Start optimization
solve_model(dispatch_model)
```

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}

**Solution**

1. Model is called 'dispatch' but referenced as 'dispatch_model'
2. Objective should minimize costs, not maximize
3. Power balance constraint uses '===' instead of '=='
4. 'solve_model' should be 'optimize!'
