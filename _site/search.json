    "text": "Welcome to this interactive Julia tutorial which introduces the basics of variables and types. Understanding variables and their types is crucial as they are the building blocks of any program. They determine how data is stored, manipulated, and how efficiently your code runs.\nThis script is designed to be interactive. Follow the instructions, write your code in the designated code blocks, and then execute the corresponding code. Each exercise is followed by an @assert statement that checks your solution.\nThere are two ways to run the code:\n\nThe easiest way to run the code is by using VS Code. First, install the Julia and the Jupyter Extension. Then, you can open the downloaded .ipynb files and run the code from there.\nThe second way is by using IJulia. Start Julia, and type using IJulia; notebook() in the Julia prompt. This will open a new browser window where you can run the code. If you have not installed IJulia yet, you can do so by typing ] in the Julia prompt to open the package manager, and then installing IJulia by typing add IJulia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlways replace ‘YOUR CODE BELOW’ with your actual code.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Course Description\nIn this module we will focus on solving practical energy system problems with the help of optimization. Over the course of the semester, you will become familiar with advanced Operations Research methods and mathematical programming techniques applied to real-world energy challenges. You’ll work on diverse problems including renewable integration, storage optimization, and green hydrogen value chain optimization - all using modern programming tools. The module consists of lectures and hands-on programming exercises, totaling 2 semester hours per week (SWS). Students can earn 2.5 credit points through a portfolio examination that includes the programming excercieses (10%) and a final exam (90%).\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\nYou can find our specific outcomes in the module handbook. Our broader goal is to enable you to tackle complex energy system optimization problems independently. We want you to develop both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills. Is our module hard? That’s a subjective question. We would say it is exciting and doable. If you have a basic interest in logical relationships and mathematics, you are in the right place. If you also have basic knowledge of programming or want to get into the subject with help, our module is perfect for you.\nUpon completion of the course, you …\n\ncan implement solutions to complex energy system optimization problems in Julia\nunderstand fundamental concepts of Operations Research and mathematical programming\nknow advanced optimization techniques including linear and mixed-integer programming\ncan develop and analyze mathematical models for energy system planning\nknow basic concepts of programming and algorithms such as loops, functions\nwill be able to read and write code in Julia\nwill have experience working with Julia libraries such as JuMP and HiGHS\nwill know how to collaborate in a small team to find solutions for problems at hand\nwill know how to tackle real-world energy system challenges\n\nPlease note that this course welcomes students from diverse study backgrounds interested in the field of energy from engineering and business perspective. While basic programming knowledge and mathematics fundamentals are prerequisites, it is not required to have any advanced knowledge or experience in programming to attend this course. The teaching format will make it possible to account for different levels of programming skills such that every student can take the most out of the course.\n\n\nCourse Blocks\nThe core content of the course is organized in three blocks:\n\nPart I: Introduction to Julia and Modelling\nPart II: Energy System Optimization with Basic Models\nPart III: Energy System Optimization with Advanced Models\n\nYou can find more information on the course blocks and the corresponding lectures in the syllabus.\n\n\nTutorials\nThe tutorials accompany the lectures. In the tutorials, you will apply the concepts from the lectures to realistic data sets. You will work in small groups of 2-3 participants, in which you can work out solutions together. We will help you during the weekly practice sessions by answering your questions or briefly explaining individual issues in case of difficulties. Afterwards, you have the opportunity to submit your jointly developed solution until the next exercise date in order to earn bonus points for the exam. You can earn up to half a bonus point per exercise, up to 6.0 bonus points in total. Important: the bonus points will only be credited to you if you pass the exam with at least a 4.0. Furthermore, we will not award bonus points for exercises in which you have simply copied the results of another group.\n\n\nHow to see the slides\n\nThis course is based on Quarto\nIt uses revealjs to render the slides\nYou find the slides for each lecture in the corresponding lecture\nTo see the slides, click on RevealJS in the top right side in the lecture\n\n\n\nQuestions\nIf you have any questions regarding the course, please contact me under tobias.cors@haw-hamburg.de.\n\n\nContributors\nThanks to Tobias Vlcek, who helped to prepare the lecture materials, especially for the first part of the course.",

For example, there are packages for working with data, creating visualizations, or solving complex math problems.\nThe best part? Most Julia packages are free to use, thanks to the open-source community!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile we’ll practice some commands here, you’ll typically manage packages in Julia’s REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), which is like Julia’s command center.",

Don’t worry if “advanced solver options” sounds intimidating - we’ll break everything down into simple, easy-to-understand concepts.\nImagine you’re using a GPS app to find the best route to a new restaurant. Just like how you can adjust settings in your GPS (like avoiding toll roads or preferring highways), we can adjust settings in our optimization solver to help it find solutions more efficiently or to meet specific requirements.\nBy the end of this tutorial, you’ll be able to: 1. Understand what solver options are and why they’re useful 2. Set basic solver options like time limits and solution tolerances 3. Interpret solver output to understand how well your problem was solved\nLet’s start by loading the necessary packages:\n\nusing JuMP, HiGHS\n\nPrecompiling JuMP...\n    545.5 ms  ✓ BenchmarkTools\n  14866.8 ms  ✓ MathOptInterface\n   6940.5 ms  ✓ JuMP\n  3 dependencies successfully precompiled in 22 seconds. 48 already precompiled.\nPrecompiling HiGHS...\n   5222.9 ms  ✓ HiGHS\n  1 dependency successfully precompiled in 5 seconds. 51 already precompiled.",

Before we start, let’s load the necessary packages and data.\n\nusing JuMP, HiGHS\nusing CSV\nusing DataFrames\nusing Plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t installed the packages yet, you can do so by running using Pkg first and then Pkg.add(\"JuMP\"), Pkg.add(\"HiGHS\"), Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\"), Pkg.add(\"Plots\"), and Pkg.add(\"StatsPlots\").\n\n\nNow, let’s load the data. The generator data (\\(p^{\\min}_g, p^{\\max}_g, c^{var}_g, c^{fix}_g\\)), \\(c^{fix}_g\\) being fixed cost not used in the ED, the wind data (\\(c^{var}_w\\)), and the scenario data (\\(p^f_w, d^f\\)) are provided as CSV files.\n\n# Get the directory of the current file\nfile_directory = \"$(@__DIR__)/data\"\n\n# Load the data of the thermal generators\ngenerators = CSV.read(\"$file_directory/generator.csv\", DataFrame)\nprintln(\"Number of generator: $(nrow(generators))\")\nprintln(\"First 5 rows of available genrator:\")\nprintln(generators[1:5, :])\n\nNumber of generator: 6\nFirst 5 rows of available genrator:\n5×5 DataFrame\n Row │ name     min_power  max_power  variable_cost  fix_cost \n     │ String3  Int64      Int64      Int64          Int64    \n─────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n   1 │ G1             100        500             50      1000\n   2 │ G2              50        350             60      1200\n   3 │ G3              40        250             55      1300\n   4 │ G4              30        200             70      1500\n   5 │ G5              30        200             60      1500\n\n\n\n# Load the data of the wind turbines\nwindTurbines = CSV.read(\"$file_directory/windTurbine.csv\", DataFrame)\nprintln(\"Number of wind turbines: $(nrow(windTurbines))\")\nprintln(\"Variable cost per wind turbine:\")\nprintln(windTurbines)\n\nNumber of wind turbines: 1\nVariable cost per wind turbine:\n1×2 DataFrame\n Row │ name     var_cost \n     │ String3  Int64    \n─────┼───────────────────\n   1 │ T1             50\n\n\n\n# Load the sceanrio data about the demand and wind forecast\nscenarios = CSV.read(\"$file_directory/scenario.csv\", DataFrame)\nprintln(\"First 5 rows of sceanios:\")\nprintln(scenarios[1:5, :])\n\nFirst 5 rows of sceanios:\n5×3 DataFrame\n Row │ name     wind_forecast  demand_forecast \n     │ String3  Int64          Int64           \n─────┼─────────────────────────────────────────\n   1 │ S1                1000             1500\n   2 │ S2                1000             1600\n   3 │ S3                1000             1400\n   4 │ S4                1000             1300\n   5 │ S5                1000             1000\n\n\nNext, you need to prepare the given data for the model. We will use ‘function’ to create a ‘Named Tuple’ which we can access with the dot notation:\n\n# This function creates the Named Tuple ThermalGenerator\nfunction ThermalGenerator(\n    min::Int64,\n    max::Int64,\n    fixed_cost::Int64,\n    variable_cost::Int64,\n)\n    return (\n        min = min,\n        max = max,\n        fixed_cost = fixed_cost,\n        variable_cost = variable_cost,\n    )\nend\n\n# Add generators of the data to a dictionary of the generators\ndictThermalGeneartors = Dict(row.name =&gt; ThermalGenerator(row.min_power, row.max_power, row.fix_cost, row.variable_cost) for row in eachrow(generators))\n\n# Now a generator propety can be accessed\nprintln(dictThermalGeneartors[\"G1\"].variable_cost)\n\nAnalogously create a dictionary for the wind turbines and scenarios. Call them dictWindTurbines and dictScenarios.\n\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Validate your solution\n@assert length(dictThermalGeneartors) == nrow(generators) \"Available time dictionary should have same length as input data\"\n@assert length(dictWindTurbines) == nrow(windTurbines) \"Available time dictionary should have same length as input data\"\n@assert length(dictScenarios) == nrow(scenarios) \"Bottling time dictionary should have same length as input data\"\n\n# Check that all values are positive\n@assert all(v -&gt; all(x -&gt; x &gt;= 0, [v.min, v.max, v.fixed_cost, v.variable_cost]), values(dictThermalGeneartors)) \"All thermal generator values must be positive\"\n@assert all(v -&gt; v.variable_cost &gt;= 0, values(dictWindTurbines)) \"All wind turbine values must be positive\"\n@assert all(v -&gt; all(x -&gt; x &gt;= 0, [v.wind_forecast, v.demand_forecast]), values(dictScenarios)) \"All scenario values must be positive\"\n\n# Check that dictionaries contain all expected keys\n@assert all(p -&gt; haskey(dictThermalGeneartors, p), generators.name) \"Missing names in dictionary\"\n@assert all(b -&gt; haskey(dictWindTurbines, b), windTurbines.name) \"Missing names in dictionary\"\n@assert all(b -&gt; haskey(dictScenarios, b), scenarios.name) \"Missing names in dictionary\"\n\n\nNext, we define the model instance for the ED problem.\n\n# Prepare the model instance\ndispatchModel = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)\n\nNow, create your variables. Please name them p_g for the power output of generators, p_w for the power injection of wind turbines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nConsider the bounds for these variables. First, we only want to solve the model for sceanrio “S1”.\n\n\n\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Validate your solution\n# Check variable dimensions\n@assert length(p_g) == length(dictThermalGeneartors) \"Incorrect dimensions for p_g\"\n@assert length(p_w) == length(dictWindTurbines) \"Incorrect dimensions for p_w\"\n\n# Check variable types\n@assert all(x -&gt; is_valid(dispatchModel, x), p_g) \"p_g must be valid variables\"\n@assert all(x -&gt; is_valid(dispatchModel, x), p_w) \"p_w must be valid variables\"\n\n\nNext, define the objective function.\n\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Validate your solution\n# Check if the model has an objective\n@assert objective_function(dispatchModel) !== nothing \"Model must have an objective function\"\n\n# Check if it's a minimization problem\n@assert objective_sense(dispatchModel) == MOI.MIN_SENSE \"Objective should be minimization\"\n\n# Check if the objective function contains both cost components\nobj_expr = objective_function(dispatchModel)\n@assert contains(string(dispatchModel), \"p_g\") \"Objective must include variable costs (p_g)\"\n@assert contains(string(dispatchModel), \"p_w\") \"Objective must include variable costs (p_w)\"\n\n\nNow, we need to define all necessary constraints for the model, which is only the demand/production balance constraint as we considered min and max power limitations in the variable setup.\n\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\n\nFinally, implement the solve statement for your model instance and print the results.\n\n# YOUR CODE BELOW\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Validate your solution\n@assert objective_value(dispatchModel) == 76600 \"Objective value should be 76600\"\n\n\n\n\n2. Solving scenarios of the ED problem\nWe now want to solve all sceanrios. To do so we wrap the model in a function that we then can call with different inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCopy your model into the function. The results should be stored in the dataframe.\n\n\n\n# Create a function `solve_economic_dispatch`, which solves the economic\n# dispatch problem for a given set of input parameters.\n\nfunction solve_economic_dispatch(dictThermalGeneartors::Dict, dictWindTurbines::Dict, scenario)\n    ## Define the economic dispatch (ED) model\n    dispatchModel = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)\n    set_silent(dispatchModel)\n    ## Define decision variables\n    ## p_g power output of generators\n    # YOUR CODE BELOW\n    \n    ## p_w wind power injection\n    # YOUR CODE BELOW\n\n    ## Define the objective function\n    # YOUR CODE BELOW\n  \n    ## Define the power balance constraint\n    # YOUR CODE BELOW\n    \n    ## Solve statement\n    optimize!(dispatchModel)\n    assert_is_solved_and_feasible(dispatchModel)\n\n    ## return the optimal value of the objective function and variables\n    return (\n        p_g = value.(p_g),\n        p_w = value.(p_w),\n        wind_curtailment = scenario.wind_forecast - sum(value.(p_w)),\n        total_cost = objective_value(dispatchModel),\n    )\nend\n\n# Create a dataframe to store results\nresults_df = DataFrame(\n    scenario = String[],\n    total_cost = Float64[],\n    wind_curtailment = Float64[]\n)\n\n# Loop over the scenarios and save the results to a dataframe\nfor (scenario_name, scenario_data) in dictScenarios\n    solution = solve_economic_dispatch(dictThermalGeneartors, dictWindTurbines, scenario_data)\n    push!(results_df, (scenario_name, solution.total_cost, solution.wind_curtailment))\nend\n\n# Print the dataframe\nprintln(\"\\nResults for all scenarios:\")\nprintln(results_df)\n\nWhat is the problem in scenario “S5” with the assumptions made in the ED problem leading to an inefficient usage of wind turbines?\n\n# YOUR ANSWER HERE\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\nYou will likely find solutions to most exercises online. However, I strongly encourage you to work on these exercises independently without searching explicitly for the exact answers to the exercises. Understanding someone else’s solution is very different from developing your own. Use the lecture notes and try to solve the exercises on your own. This approach will significantly enhance your learning and problem-solving skills.\nRemember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities. If you encounter difficulties, review the lecture materials, experiment with different approaches, and don’t hesitate to ask for clarification during class discussions.\nLater, you will find the solutions to these exercises online in the associated GitHub repository, but we will also quickly go over them in next week’s tutorial. To access the solutions, click on the Github button on the lower right and search for the folder with today’s lecture and tutorial. Alternatively, you can ask ChatGPT or Claude to explain them to you. But please remember, the goal is not just to complete the exercises, but to understand the concepts and improve your programming abilities.",
